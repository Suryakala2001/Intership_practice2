//Create a program that simulates an organization with different types of employees and departments. The program should have the following classes/interfaces:
//Employee - This is an abstract class that has the properties of an employee such as name, age, salary, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
//Department - This is an abstract class that has the properties of a department such as name, budget, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also have an interface named "Operation" that has a method named "performOperation" which will be implemented by different department operations such as hiring, firing, budget allocation, etc.
//Manager - This is a derived class of the Employee class. It should have additional properties such as team, department, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
//Developer - This is a derived class of the Employee class. It should have additional properties such as technology, experience, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
//Marketing - This is a derived class of the Department class. It should have additional properties such as campaigns, events, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also implement the "Operation" interface with a method implementation of the "performOperation" method that will simulate marketing campaigns and events.
//IT - This is a derived class of the Department class. It should have additional properties such as technology, infrastructure, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also implement the "Operation" interface with a method implementation of the "performOperation" method that will simulate IT operations such as hiring, firing, and budget allocation.
//In the main method, create objects of different types of employees and departments, and simulate employee management and department operations by calling the "performOperation" method of the respective department.

//A book management system is a software application designed to help users manage their books and related information, such as author names, publishers, book categories, and book availability. The system can be used by individuals or institutions, such as libraries, bookstores, and schools.

//The key features of a book management system typically include:

//Book inventory management: The system should allow users to add, update, and delete books from the inventory. It should also keep track of the number of copies available, the location of each book, and any other relevant information.

//Cataloging: The system should provide an efficient way to organize books by author, title, category, and other relevant criteria. This will help users quickly find the book they need.

//Borrowing and lending management: The system should allow users to track the borrowing and lending of books. It should also keep track of due dates and any overdue fines.

//Reporting: The system should provide reports on book availability, overdue books, and other relevant information. This will help users make informed decisions about book management.

//User management: The system should allow users to create and manage accounts, and control access to books and other resources.

//Overall, a book management system can help individuals and institutions to efficiently manage their book inventory, save time, and reduce errors. It can also provide valuable insights into book usage patterns, which can inform purchasing decisions and other strategic decisions.
